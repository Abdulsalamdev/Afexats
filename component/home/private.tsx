          As a commodities exchange, AFEX has invested in financial education
          initiatives to enhance financial literacy among investors and improve
          participation for retail and institutional investors in the

          financial market knowledge and confidence of investors through
          digitally distributed learning materials, data-driven market reports,
          webinars, and outreach programs, which have driven up active

        <p className="pt-[20px]">
          “AFEX is pleased to once again ring the bell to advocate for financial
          literacy on the commodities market in Africa. Financial literacy and
          investor protection are important tenets that drive growth and
          inclusivity in the financial market, and as part of our efforts to
          promote sustainability in the ecosystem, we have developed a wholistic
          engagement framework that empowers retail and institutional investors
          to take advantage of the opportunities in the commodities market
          within the current market environment.

          Currently, we are gearing up to launch a four-part comic book designed
          to educate new and existing investors of all ages on how the
          commodities market works and how they can grow their wealth by
          leveraging alternative assest classes. As a participation grows, it is
          improtant to simplify financial management and investment so that no

          To bridge knowledge gaps, initiatives like knowledge-sharing sessions,
          video tutorials, one-on-one sessions with financial experts, and
          detailed reports on commodity value chains are being incorporated into
          AFEX's technology platforms, allowing access to important trading
          data, trends, and financial information, thereby bringing support and
          growth to the commodities market.

          According to Fiona Ahime, MD, FBN Quest, “Investors should embrace
          diversification of investment”. Charles Egbunonwo, the MD of
          Forthright Securities, and a member of the Financial Literacy
          Committee also commented that “It is important to create awareness on
          financial literacy to unlock the potentials in the commodities space.
          If we are looking to diversify our economy, commodities are one of the
          key products to consider and develop. I am happy we are putting hands
          together to propagate the investment culture in the commodities

          Achieving investor resilience and sustainable finance requires a
          broad-based effort on the part of all capital market players to
          provide investors with the tools and knowledge required to make
          informed investment decisions. Addressing these core areas lays a
